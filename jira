’m not entirely sure how much scope we have for the Smart Assistant in Q1, but here are the items I’ve identified as potential focus areas. Please guide me on what we should prioritize or let me know if there’s anything else you’d like me to work on:

Enhancing DDP Pipeline Support Features:

Scale support to cover more use cases and handle complex scenarios effectively.
Enhancing the Admin Page:

Provide detailed usage reports and dashboards for better monitoring and insights.
Integration with SharePoint API:

Almost complete—if the APIs perform as expected, we can showcase enhanced documentation finder capabilities in the next couple of weeks.
New Feature Ideas:

Expanding Scope to SEM: Provide insights at the task level for more granular reporting.
Fortify Info at CommitHash Level: Extract and display security insights tied to commit hashes for improved traceability.
Proof of Concept for Self-Healing: Explore making identified issues self-healable.
DDP Pipeline API Integration: Enable direct integration of Smart Assistant APIs within DDP pipelines, allowing users to get assistance without navigating to the EDSO UI.
Let me know your thoughts on these items or if there’s anything specific you’d like me to prioritize.

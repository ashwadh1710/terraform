Based on the provided analysis and images, here is the detailed **Jira Story** creation for the patching solution of existing deployed container applications in the OpenShift (OCP) cluster:

### **Jira Story Template:**

#### **Title:**
Patching Solution for Existing Deployed Container Applications in OCP Clusters

---

#### **Description:**
As a DevOps engineer, I need a robust patching solution for updating the base images of existing deployed containerized applications in OpenShift (OCP) clusters, ensuring that the applications run on the latest, secure base images without rebuilding the application artifacts or redeploying from Helm charts.

---

#### **Acceptance Criteria:**
1. The solution should dynamically fetch deployed images in the OCP cluster across multiple namespaces/projects.
2. The base images of the deployed container images should be updated to the latest available version without modifying application-specific layers.
3. The updated images should be pushed to the container registry.
4. Deployment configurations in the cluster should be updated with the new image versions.
5. Validation of deployments post-patching should be automated to confirm successful updates.
6. Integration with Jenkins pipeline for end-to-end automation of the process.

---

#### **Tasks:**
1. **Cluster and Namespace Identification:**
   - Fetch the list of OCP clusters from user input.
   - Authenticate and login to each cluster (`oc login <cluster-url>`).
   - Identify namespaces/projects to include or exclude for patching.

2. **Fetch Deployed Images:**
   - Use `oc` commands to list all deployments and their associated container images within each namespace/project.
   - Maintain a record of all discovered deployments and images.

3. **Update Base Images:**
   - Build new container images using the patched base image while retaining application-specific layers.
   - Push the updated images to the container registry.

4. **Update Deployment Configurations:**
   - Update the deployment YAMLs directly with the new image tags.
   - Ensure the changes are propagated to the running pods in the OCP cluster.

5. **Validation:**
   - Validate that updated pods are running with the new image versions.
   - Verify application health and ensure no disruptions in service.

6. **Jenkins Pipeline:**
   - Integrate the above steps into an automated Jenkins pipeline.
   - Ensure the pipeline supports running for specific namespaces, clusters, or environments.

#### **Comments:**
##### **Analysis Notes:**
- Refer to the analysis documents and images attached for detailed implementation steps and the pseudo-code.
- Key steps include:
  - Identifying clusters and namespaces (`oc4 login` and `oc4 list projects`).
  - Fetching existing deployments and images.
  - Building new images using the latest base image and pushing to the registry.
  - Updating deployments via `helm update` or `oc` commands (`oc set image` or `oc patch`).

##### **Pseudo-code:**
```python
input_clusters = user_input_cluster_url.split(",").trim()
for cluster_url in input_clusters:
    Login to the target cluster  # oc4 login "${cluster_url}"
    ocp_projects = "oc4 list projects"

    for ocp_project in ocp_projects:
        deployments = []  # Query deployments at project level
        for deployment in deployments:
            deployed_images = []  # Query images for each deployment
            for deployed_image in deployed_images:
                new_image_name = f"{deployed_image}_patched"
                # Build the new image
                "docker build new_image_name ./"
                "docker push"
                
                # Update the deployment with the new image
                "oc set image deployment/${deployment} container=${new_image_name}"
```

##### **Performance Metrics:**
- Average time for patching an image: ~15s.
- Time for deployment update: ~325ms.
- Validation time: ~324ms.

#### **Attachments:**
1. Attached images for the high-level analysis, pseudo-code, and pipeline performance metrics.
2. Example screenshots of `oc` commands and pipeline tests validating the solution.

---

#### **Priority:**
High (to address security compliance and update base images for deployed applications).

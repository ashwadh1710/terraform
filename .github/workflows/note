Last week, 8888 from xyz reached out to discuss whether we could capture the abc response in the chain of custody for auditing purposes. Currently, in the release infrastructure packaging pipeline for IaC code, we make an API call to CGI to retrieve the application's compliance status. The pipeline proceeds to the next step only if the compliance check passes; otherwise, it fails. However, I believe we are not currently storing this response in metadata. The request is to capture and store this information in metadata, which is likely why they scheduled a call to discuss it further.
